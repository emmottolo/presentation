Hi there, I'm Emma! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a psychology student at UniversitÃ  Cattolica of Milan with a passion for technology, programming, and data science. Here, you'll find projects and repositories where I explore the intersection of psychology and tech, along with experiments and tools for my personal learning journey.
